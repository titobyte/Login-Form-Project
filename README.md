# TPD Coding 2023 FE

I choosen the following coding challenges to develop and share with the development team

1. Build a Responsive Navigation Menu
Objective: Create a responsive navigation menu that changes from a horizontal bar to a hamburger menu on smaller screens.
Bonus: Use JavaScript or CSS animations to enhance the hamburger menu's opening and closing actions. 

2. Create a Form with Validation
Objective: Design a user form with various fields (name, email, password, etc.). Implement client-side validation that checks the correctness of the input before submission.
Must: Display custom error messages and highlight fields with errors using CSS.
